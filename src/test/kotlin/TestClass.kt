    /**
     * So, here are your two superheroes to make the developers life easyâ€”TestObserver and
     * TestSubscriber. As with Subscriber and Observer, you can use TestSubscriber
     * with Flowables and TestObserver with Observables, everything except that is similar
     * between these two.
     *
     *
     * Let's now understand the test cases.
     * On comment (1), we are subscribing to the
     * Observable/Flowable.
     *
     * On comment (2), we are checking if the Subscription was successful
     * and was only one with the help of the assertSubscribed() test.
     *
     * On comment (3), we are blocking the thread until the Observable/Flowable completes its execution with the
     * awaitTerminalEvent() method. This terminal event can be onComplete or onError as
     * well.
     *
     * On comments (4) and (5), we are checking whether the Observable and/or
     * Flowable has completed successfully without any errors, assertNoErrors() will test
     * whether the Subscription hasn't received any errors and
     *
     * assertComplete() will test whether the producer has completed successfully .
     *
     * On comment (6), we are testing that the total received emission count was 20 (there were 20 items in the list),
     * assertValuesCount() helps us with this objective.
     *
     * On comment (6), with the help of assertValues() we are testing the expected and actual values of each of the emissions in its order.
     * */
