/**
 * Now, as you've some hands-on testing in Kotlin and have some idea about RxKotlin as
 * well, you may be wondering how to implement test cases in RxKotlin? It is true that testing
 * in RxKotlin may not seem straightforward; the reason is that ReactiveX defines behavior
 * rather than states, and most testing frameworks, including JUnit and kotlinâ€”test are good
 * for testing states.
 * To the aid of developers, RxKotlin comes with a set of tools for testing, which you can use
 * with your favorite testing frameworks. In this book, we will cover testing in RxKotlin with
 * JUnit and Kotlin-test.
