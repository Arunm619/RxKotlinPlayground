/**
 * Unit testing is a level of software testing where the
 * individual smallest testable components of a software (aka application), called units are
 * tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as it was supposed
 * to.
 *
 * Unit tests can be done manually, but they are often automated. The sole purpose of
 * automated unit testing is to reduce human error and eliminate any extra bugs/errors caused
 * by them.
 * To explain let's first remember the proverb:
 * >>>>>>>To err is human<<<<<<<<
 *
 * So, if we do the unit tests manually, the chances of additional errors or bugs will rise.
 * Automated unit tests can eliminate this risk as they include minimal human effort
 *
 *  we should write
 * unit tests for each and every functional section of our applications
 * By functional section we mean each section that performs any small
 * operation and/or function. We can skip testing a POJO class with just
 * getters and setters, but we must test the code which uses that POJO class
 * to accomplish something.
