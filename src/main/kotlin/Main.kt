/**
 * When to use flatMap operator
 * Take a look at the following listâ€”it contains the contexts and situations where flatMap will
 * fit best:
 * When you're working with a list of data within a page, activity, or fragment and
 * want to send some data to a server or a database per item of the list. The
 * concatMap operator will also do here; however, as the flatMap operator works
 * asynchronously, it'll be faster, and, as you're sending data, the order doesn't
 * really matter.
 * Whenever you want to perform any operation on list items asynchronously and
 * in a comparatively short time period.
 * When to use concatMap operator
 * So, when to use concatMap?
 * The following list contains the contexts and situations where concatMap will fit best:
 * When you are downloading the list of data to display to the user. The order really
 * matters here, you will surely not want to load and display the second item of the
 * list after the third and fourth one are already displayed, would you?
 * Performing some operation on a sorted list, making sure the list stays the same
